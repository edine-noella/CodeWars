//must identify all possible paths the bee can take from point A to point B
//the bee can move south,north and west
//the N is the like the number of cirlce grid steps from inside to outside for the hexagon
//the bee will always travel N-1 steps because we are not counting the starting step
//the bee moves in three directions (south,north and west) so it can take 3* (N-1) moves
//but there is still alot of possible paths that the bee can take from those three mvoes depending on N
//this is where binomial coefficient comes in
